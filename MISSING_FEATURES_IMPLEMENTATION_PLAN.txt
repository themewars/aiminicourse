üéØ FINAL NOTES:

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building a comprehensive 
admin panel and billing system for AiCourse. Each phase builds upon the previous 
one, ensuring a solid foundation before adding advanced features.

Priority should be given to Phase 1 and Phase 2 as they contain critical features 
needed for production deployment. Subsequent phases can be implemented based on 
business needs and resource availability.

Regular reviews and adjustments to this plan are recommended based on user feedback, 
market changes, and technical discoveries during implementation.
